    "The dominating operations during an iteration of either Steepest Descent or CG are matrix-vector products. In general, matrix-vector multiplication requires $\\mathcal{O}(m)$ operations, where $m$ is the number of non-zero entries in the matrix. For many problems, including those listed in the introduction, $A$ is sparse and $m \\in \\mathcal{O}(n)$.\n",
